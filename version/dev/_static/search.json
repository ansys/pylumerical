These commands typically start with “add”, for example, addrect or addfdtd.\n\nIn PyLumerical, you can create simulation objects in many different ways.\nAt a fundamental level, you can create objects and have their properties set like a Lumerical script using set and setnamed.\n\nIn addition, PyLumerical also supports assigning properties to object in a way more native to Python, either by creating a dictionary and assigning it to the properties attribute during initialization or using keyword arguments directly.\nWhen constructing objects using these methods, you may need to initialize some properties in order, and some properties may overwrite other properties. Therefore, it’s recommended to use an ordered dictionary to ensure that you set these properties as intended.\n\nThe examples below show various methods on object construction.\nFor more information regarding adding and manipulating simulation objects, including best practices, see the article on Working with simulation objects.\nWhen a property has a space in its name, for example, x span, the name for keyword arguments uses an underscore instead of space, for example, x_span.\n\nExample\n\nThese examples create a 3D FDTD region centered at the origin and with a span of 1μm.\n\nFirstly, using the Lumerical script commands:\n\nThe following code creates the FDTD region uses an ordered dictionary to set its properties.\n\nThe following code creates the FDTD region using keyword arguments\n\nFor more information regarding adding and manipulating simulation objects, including other ways to interact with these objects and best practices see the article on Working with simulation objects."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"user_guide/script_commands_as_methods.html#importing-custom-script-commands","title":"Script commands as methods > Importing custom script commands","text":"Importing custom script commands\n\nIn addition to default script commands, you can also take advantage of the auto-syncing function feature in PyLumerical and import functions that are pre-defined in a Lumerical script file (.lsf file).\nTo import these functions, you can either execute the scripts while constructing the session using the script keyword argument, or manually evaluating the file using the ansys.lumerical.core.FDTD.eval() method.\n\nThe ansys.lumerical.core.FDTD.eval() is common to all products, and is available as ansys.lumerical.core.MODE.eval(), ansys.lumerical.core.DEVICE.eval(), and ansys.lumerical.core.INTERCONNECT.eval().\n\nExample\n\nThe following two .lsf files contains custom functions.\n\nMyFunctions.lsf\n\nMyFunctions2.lsf\n\nThe following script imports functions from both custom script files upon session creation.\n\nReturns"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"user_guide/script_commands_as_methods.html#non-constructor-script-commands","title":"Script commands as methods > Non-constructor script commands","text":"Non-constructor script commands\n\nFor script commands that needs input arguments, but don’t create simulation objects, you can only use them with position arguments and not keyword arguments.\n\nFor example, the following code results in an error, even though the set script command takes property and value as input arguments.\n\nExample\n\nThe correct usage is the following.\n\nThis applies also to methods defined in other scripting files that are loaded by first evaluating the script file.\n\nExample\n\nA Lumerical script file named MyConstructor.lsf contains the following function definition.\n\nThe following Python driver script causes an error, even though the function defined in the script file have arguments named x_input, y_input, and z_input.\n\nIn contrast, the following driver script executes without error, and add both the FDTD region as well as the rectangle."},{"objectID":"Home","href":"user_guide/script_commands_as_methods.html#unsupported-methods","title":"Script commands as methods > Unsupported methods","text":"Unsupported methods\n\nWhile most script commands are available, there are a few categories of commands that aren’t available for use in PyLumerical.

If you do not specify a project, they will run in a new blank project.\n\nNotes\n\nIn addition to the class methods below, Lumerical objects dynamically define methods that correspond to Lumerical script commands when you instantiate them.\n\nFor more information, see the Script commands as methods article in the User guide.\n\nMethods\n\n"},{"objectID":"Home","href":"api/_autosummary/ansys.lumerical.core.INTERCONNECT.putv.html#putv","title":"putv","text":"putv\n\n\n\nINTERCONNECT.putv(varname, value)\n\nLow level script workspace method that puts a variable from the local Python environment into an active Lumerical session.\n\nThis method is a low level method that interacts directly with the script workspace in Lumerical.
